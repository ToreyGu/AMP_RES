# AMP_RES
The high-frequency signal for measuring impedance in this circuit is generated by a Vineland bridge oscillator, which is optimized for easy starting using two Schottky diodes

The signal source toggle switch selects the system internal excitation/external excitation. When internal excitation is used, the sinusoidal waveform of this system is generated by the Venn diagram oscillator, and when external excitation is used, the sinusoidal waveform of this circuit is generated by the signal source.
